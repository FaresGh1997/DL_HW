Various Deep Learning Projects (2022- 2023)


This repo demonstrates multiple Deep Learning Techniques including:
1. introduction to Deep learning: Solving digit recognition problem by building a from scratch neural network and loss function.
2. Deep dive into neural network structures, loss functions, backpropagation, and Traning loops.
3. Building self made neural network for Computer vision tasks, solving image recognition problem on [CIFAR dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/fall19/week03_convnets/cifar.py).
4. Using pretrained model on [ImageNet dataset for image classification](https://image-net.org/) and [Dogs Vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
5. Perform Natural Language Processing using Encoder-Decoder structure to estimate the salary based on the job titile.
6. Introducing CBOW and Word2vec neural networks to solve embeddings tasks.
7. Deep dive into Transformers pre-trained models.
8. Deep models interpretability using SHapley and smoothgrad
9. Large Lanugae Models and Thier Implications, Prompet engineering, LLM fine-tuning.
10. Introduction to Denoising Autoencoders and Image retrival problem.
11. Development of GAN (Genrative Adversarial Networks) for human faces generationg tasks.
