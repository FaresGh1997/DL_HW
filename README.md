Various Deep Learning Projects (2022- 2023)


This repo demonstrates multiple Deep Learning Techniques including:
1. introduction to Deep learning: Solving digit recognition problem by building a from scratch neural network and loss function.
2. Deep dive into neural network structures, loss functions, backpropagation, and Training loops.
3. Building self-made neural network for Computer vision tasks, solving image recognition problem on [CIFAR dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/fall19/week03_convnets/cifar.py).
4. Using pretrained model on [ImageNet dataset for image classification](https://image-net.org/) and [Dogs Vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
5. Perform Natural Language Processing using Encoder-Decoder structure to estimate the salary based on the job title.
6. Introducing CBOW and Word2vec neural networks to solve embeddings tasks.
7. Deep dive into Transformers pre-trained models.
8. Deep models interpretability using SHapley and smooth grad
9. Large Language Models and Their Implications, Prompt engineering, LLM fine-tuning.
10. Introduction to Denoising Autoencoders and Image retrieval problem.
11. Development of GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) for human faces generation tasks.
12. Speech processing pipeline using Deep learning.
